This week marks the start of a new journey for me. I’m super excited to announce that I have joined the Product Team at Investis Digital as Lead Fullstack Product Engineer.

I learned a tonne in my Technical Director role at Coherence Digital and look forward to learning more on this new adventure. This is my first time on a product team and I’m excited to be working with Drupal and Gatsby creating the future of website creation.
