Gatsby 5 came out last Tuesday and Iâ€™ve just completed the upgrade of my blog from Gatsby 4 to Gatsby 5. In the past, this process had been painful and I was left pulling out my hair (something I canâ€™t afford to do â€” male pattern baldness is real!).

You can see the results at [https://xavie.mirmon.co.uk](https://xavie.mirmon.co.uk).

*If you are curious about the benefits of upgrading to Gatsby 5 check out my other blog post about [Gatsby 5â€™s enhancements](https://medium.com/xaviemirmon/gatsby-5-is-coming-fast-gets-faster-f515824dc515).*

However, this experience was much simpler than I expected. The upgrade guide is extensive and helped walk me through the different steps required to upgrade. Fortunately for me, I have built my site on top of gatsby-theme-jodie built by a Gatsby core maintainer [LekoArts](undefined). This theme was already ready for Gatsby 5, so I only needed to update any customisations Iâ€™d made through shadowing.

## A note on Gatsby Themes

The more I work with Gatsby Themes and shadowing, the more I learn the intricate differences to the likes of contributed plugins/modules on CMS.â€™ Because we are essentially using Webpack to overlay files on top of one another the process of upgrading can look very different for you. Iâ€™ve found that there is extra effort required to update the shadowed files when an underlying file has changed compared to that of Drupal or WordPress. I was fortunate that the theme I use was updated quickly. However, your specific themeâ€™s maintainer might take longer to push out an update so mileage may vary.

## New Feature! Medium teasers

Because this process was so quick, I decided to add a new feature which shows a grid of Medium articles on the homepage. This was built using gatsby-source-medium and the new useStaticQuery hooks approach.

I also used IFTTT to trigger my Gatsby Cloud builds when I publish a new article. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
