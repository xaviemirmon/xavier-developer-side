It’s official Gatsby 5 is dropping on November 8th 2022 and I cannot wait! As part of this update, there are many new fixes and improvements (which you can learn all about at [https://gatsby.dev/5)](<https://gatsby.dev/5)>). However, here are a few that I am most excited about.

# Slices API

With the Slices API, you can now create components that are shared across multiple pages, e.g. headers and footers as a “Slice.” It’s similar to the Pages API, but for shared global components. This is advantageous for two main reasons. 1) When your site is building, rather than needing to build multiple instances of these components it does it once and splices that bundle in where required. 2) If you change one of your “Slices,” the slice itself is the only item that needs to be rebuilt as opposed to all of the pages that contain that component.

# Partial Hydration (beta)

Currently, all pages rendered by Gatsby are “fully hydrated.” This means that static and highly interactive components are all treated equally. Without partial hydration, there is no way to instruct your site to parse or defer behaviours to the client which can lead to larger bundle sizes and time to interactive. Implementing partial hydration keeps your sites super quick!

# Head API

The “Head API” replaces `react-helmet` when adding SEO tags to the header. This API provides enhanced performance and de-duplication over `react-helmet`. It’s also incredibly simple to get started with, just add a `Head` function in your page templates to use this functionality.

# GraphiQL v2

This is a small but exciting change. Gatsby v5 now includes GraphiQL v2 which contains some much-needed UI enhancements. These enhancements include tabs, dark mode and more.

# Wrapping up

There are a lot more updates that I’ve not covered in this post such as new starters, the Script API, React 18, etc. You can find out more details in the blog post from Gatsby [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-5/). V5 doesn’t seem to be as vast a product announcement as v4 but I see that as a positive. It’s clear to me that in this update a lot more care and attention has gone into migration paths and upgrades showing that Gatsby is a much more formidable product.

_I am curious to know your thoughts. What are you most excited about with this release? Add it in the comments below._
