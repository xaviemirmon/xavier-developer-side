In this role, I've become an integral part of the management team reporting to the commercial director on how to best move the customer-facing technologies forward for the organisation. As a part of this process, I moved the site to more performant and cost-effective hosting. I also helped to change quite a few of the marketing tools on the site to more self-service options helping reduce the bottom line. I also set up an agency relationship and continually liaise with them to provide contingency support.\n\nThe primary responsibility I have at Travel Nation is to take our Drupal 7 site and migrate it to a new stack that is best for our business goals. I’ve identified that GastbyJS and Drupal 8 to be best suited to move to and have been working on the migrations and been actively contributing back to Gatsby and Drupal to make the process simpler for others.\n\nAlongside website development, I also drove the implementation of a company-wide rebrand across all channels and systems.\n\n**Senior Drupal Developer, Miggle; Brighton, East Sussex, UK**\n\nAugust 2017 — April 2018\n\nAs a Senior Drupal Developer, my responsibilities have extended to the technical consultancy of the products I’ve created. I have recently performed multiple health checks where I’ve provided direct recommendations to clients about improvements that can be made to their sites. These recommendations have also often meant performing migrations to one of our PaaS providers.\n\n**Drupal Developer and Product Manager, Miggle; Brighton, East Sussex, UK**\n\nNovember 2015 — August 2017\n\nIn addition to my Drupal Developer role, as a Product Manager, I was responsible for creating a series of products and services to improve Miggle’s offerings and visibility. I created basic and advanced health checks both of which allow Miggle to assess sites against common pain points Drupal sites face. As an agency, one of the common problems we faced was how to support and assess existing sites. Using our health checks we gained a score that identified 6 different areas which would be difficult to support or problematic for the site. I also created a hosting product to ensure we are able to offer the best hosting for the requirements of our clients. To do this we set up partnerships with the top 3 Drupal PaaS providers and also have an on-premise option.\n\n**Drupal Developer, Miggle; Brighton, East Sussex, UK**\n\nNovember 2013 — November 2015\n\nAs a Drupal Developer at Miggle, I was tasked with building a series of Drupal 7 and our first ever Drupal 8 site. With a large range of skillsets, I was able to move with the needs of the projects. Within my role, I completed various front-end tasks (theming, CSS/Compass/SASS, JS/jQuery), back-end tasks (Drupal API modules, OOP, API integrations), site-building (translations, IA, configuration), and DevOps (hosting provision, support and maintenance). I was project lead and an integral team member on a series of site builds and support contracts including Think Nation, our first Drupal site and an Acquia award winner.\n\n**Lead Developer, Alpha Wave Media; Lewes, East Sussex, UK**\n\nJuly 2013 — October 2013\n\nIn July 2013, I took on the roles and responsibilities of Lead Developer after my predecessor left. As Lead Developer, I was required to perform the same development duties as before but also make executive decisions around the technical solutions we implemented for our clients. I was also responsible for supporting legacy sites which the company had built before I joined and which utilised a wide range of different technologies. Additionally, I was required to mentor and manage a team of interns who assisted me to carry out the tasks at hand.\n\n**Developer, Alpha Wave Media; Lewes, East Sussex, UK**\n\nOctober 2012 — July 2013\n\nI developed various websites to meet the specific needs and desires of each individual client. Each was developed on top of, but limited to, the Drupal CMS and Wordpress allowing clients to edit their content in the future. My role as a developer required me to use modern web technologies such as PHP, Javascript/JQuery, and CSS alongside extensive knowledge about Drupal and Wordpress to create dynamic and engaging sites to meet the needs of the clients.\n\n**Remote Support/Bench Tech/Onsite Tech, dmi Networking Solutions; Santa Rosa, CA**\n\nSeptember 2011 — September 2012\n\nI provided remote telephone support to clients and help them solve technical issues. I also served in the capacity of a Bench Technician, which required me to prepare all systems before installations and ease technicians’ processes. My duties also required me to complete maintenance and physical repairs for computers and servers. I served as a backup on-site Technician, assisted in several on-site installations and provided emergency service to down/crashed systems.\n\n**Online Marketer, Sonoma Academy; Santa Rosa, CA**\n\nJanuary 2012 — September 2012\n\nI was hired by Sonoma Academy to create a new web-based marketing campaign for prospective students. I edited hours of digital video footage in a format to answer Frequently Asked Questions from prospective students. I created an interface targeting 12–15 year-olds, for easy access to videos of FAQs. Worked with the Head of Marketing and Head of School to ensure adherence to Sonoma Academy’s integrity on the web.\n\n**Intern/Production Assistant, TWiT.tv; Petaluma, CA**\n\nJuly 2010 — December 2010\n\nA paid internship primarily carried out July-September 2010 and on-call during the school year. Duties included: creating Drupal CMS pages for a variety of shows; uploading videos to the website; editing “teasers;” focusing and adjusting cameras and microphones for show transitions; testing audio and video quality; greeting guests, and assisting show hosts.\n\n**Education**\n\nUniversity of Sussex, Brighton, UK — Studying Music Informatics, September 2012 — September 2013\n\nSanta Rosa Junior College (University), Santa Rosa, CA — Equivalent of Minor in Music, January 2006 — December 2012 (Intermittent)\n\nSonoma Academy (High School/College), Santa Rosa, CA — High School Diploma, September 2007 — June 2011 with independent study focus on IT and web design.\n\n**Noteworthy Websites I Have Built Include**\n\n[**Homepage | ThinkNation**](http://thinknation.co/)\n\n_[Inspired by Accenture’s BIG 2017 International Women’s Day question “How far can you go?” this ThinkNation event on…](http://thinknation.co/)_\n\n[**FC Lane Electronics | Electronic Connectors**](https://www.fclane.com/)\n\n_[MIL-DTL-38999, 5015, 26482 & coaxial electrical connectors and backshells from Souriau, Huber Suhner, Weald, Amphenol…](https://www.fclane.com/)_[www.fclane.com](https://www.fclane.com/)\n\n[**Experts In Round The World Travel | Travel Nation**](https://www.travelnation.co.uk/)\n\n_[Planning a round the world trip?
