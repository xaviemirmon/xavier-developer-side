I created the Seaside Admin theme for Drupal 8 to improve the UX and expirenece of using Drupal 8.  Check it out for yourself at [https://www.drupal.org/project/seaside_admin](https://www.drupal.org/project/seaside_admin \"https://www.drupal.org/project/seaside_admin\")  or simply run:\n\n    composer require 'drupal/seaside_admin:^1.9'\n\n### This site was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [TinaCMS](https://www.tinacms.org) and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).\n\nBoth of which are super awesome you should check them out!.
