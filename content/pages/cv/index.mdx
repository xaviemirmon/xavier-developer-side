In this role, I've become an integral part of the management team reporting to the commercial director on how to best move the customer-facing technologies forward for the organisation. As a part of this process, I moved the site to more performant and cost-effective hosting. I also helped to change quite a few of the marketing tools on the site to more self-service options helping reduce the bottom line. I also set up an agency relationship and continually liaise with them to provide contingency support.

The primary responsibility I have at Travel Nation is to take our Drupal 7 site and migrate it to a new stack that is best for our business goals.
