# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Xavier

## Lead Fullstack Product Engineer

&nbsp;
 
I'm a Software Engineer based in Brighton, UK where I'm currently working for Investis Digital's product team.  


I thrive on using Open Source technologies to build products that enhance usablility and solve real problems for end-users.  I'm currently working on and maintaining the <a href="https://powerstack.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Power Stack</a> project which aims to be a low-code headless DXP based on open data architectures.
