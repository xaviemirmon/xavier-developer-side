I’m originally from Northern California, just a short drive from Silicon Valley, where I first developed a passion for technology and innovation. Now based in Brighton, UK, I bring over a decade of experience in web design, development, and strategy, with a focus on delivering cutting-edge solutions that simplify the digital landscape. Growing up surrounded by the fast-paced world of tech, I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can drive both creativity and efficiency.

In my last role at IDX, I lead teams in building decoupled, low-code platforms using technologies such as Drupal, React, Next.js, Puck, and Typescript. My experience spans everything from greenfield product development to digital transformation projects for globally recognized brands. At IDX, I’ve been instrumental in developing a new design system, revamping technical architectures, and fostering collaboration between design and development teams. These efforts have improved site performance, reduced technical debt, and significantly enhanced platform governance.

Before IDX, I served as Technical Director at Coherence Digital, where I led cross-functional teams to develop low-code page-building tools and digital strategies for large web estates. I’ve consulted for top-tier clients like Stanley Black & Decker, Bayer, and Close Brothers Merchant Bank, helping them streamline their digital ecosystems and improve efficiency across hundreds of sites. My focus on low-code solutions allowed me to accelerate product development and improve the scalability of client platforms, particularly with Acquia Site Studio.

Throughout my career, I’ve always embraced new challenges, whether it’s integrating emerging technologies, refining processes to eliminate bottlenecks, or implementing more efficient cloud hosting solutions to reduce costs. I thrive on finding innovative ways to leverage technology for business growth and user engagement, and I’m always keen to mentor and lead teams toward greater collaboration and technical excellence.

Outside of work, I’m a dedicated home cook, an avid musician, and a lover of the outdoors. When I’m not working on a web project, you can find me experimenting in the kitchen, enjoying Brighton’s vibrant craft beer scene, or renovating my Victorian home. I also love spending time on the South Downs, where I go for walks and runs with my dog. Music remains a big part of my life as well—I play the double bass, DJ, and occasionally present on the radio.

I’m passionate about both the technical and creative aspects of life, and I’m always looking for new ways to blend the two in my work. Whether developing a web platform, mentoring a team, or building my next project, I’m driven by the belief that technology should make life simpler and more accessible for everyone.
